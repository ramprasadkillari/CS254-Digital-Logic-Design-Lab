You have to maintain 2 Queues one for going up, and the other for going
down at all floors except the ground and top floor (which will have just a
single queue).

You have to maintain a counter for the number of people in the elevator
for each elevator

You have to maintain a requests from floor register that stores call
requests from floors which have people.

You have to maintain the next_floor_to_be_visited (nftbv) for each
elevator. This is the output of the state machine.

You have to maintain elevator-direction for each elevator

The FSM starts with all elevators at floor 0.

As people come in the going up Queue at floor 0 gets filled up. When it
has 8 people, the people are transported to any randomly chosen elevator.

The nftbv for that elevator is update.
The elevator goes to that floor, if there are people in between and there
is space in the elevator, then the elevator is interrupted.
Else, the elevator drops people at the floor, and then the next floor is
updated.
Once the elevator has finished dropping everyone, then it examines the two
queues, and the one which is closest is selected. This may be above or
below the present position of the elevator. Accordingly the
elevator-direction register is updated. The nftbv is also updated.
Then the elevator goes to that floor and picks up people, updating the
nftbv and people counter. It continues to collect people till it becomes
empty and the cycle repeats.
At a random floor, the call request is stored and is picked up by the
first elevator in that direction of movement.
