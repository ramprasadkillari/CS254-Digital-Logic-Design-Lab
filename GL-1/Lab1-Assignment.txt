Design a circuit Ganit such that:

Ganit can add 2 digit decimal numbers

Ganit can subtract 2 digit decimal numbers

Ganit can multiply single digit decimal numbers

Ganit can present the output of all in BCD as well as binary.

Ganit can calculate square of a single digit decimal number

Ganit has multiple select pins which determine which function is to be
implemented.

Illustrative test-bench (need not be exhaustive)


Tasks:

Write VHDL code for Ganit

Estimate the number of gates in Ganit

Write the test-bench for Ganit

What to submit:

Today: Just the VHDL code with all team membersâ€™ roll numbers at the top
along with test-bench code to ID on the board.

By Friday: The 1 page report on number of gates, functions etc. Anything
you feel should be there. Please make sure the report is not longer than 1
page (single side, 10-pt font).
